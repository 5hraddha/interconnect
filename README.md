# INTERCONNECT: Clients Churn Prediction using ML

## Introduction

In an era of rapid technological evolution, **Interconnect** is a leading telecom operator that mainly provides two types of services:

1. **Landline communication**: The telephone can be connected to several lines simultaneously.
2. **Internet**: The network can be set up via a telephone line (DSL, _digital subscriber line_) or through a fiber optic cable.

Some other services the company provides include:

- **Internet security**: antivirus software (_DeviceProtection_) and a malicious website blocker (_OnlineSecurity_)
- A dedicated technical support line (_TechSupport_)
- Cloud file storage and data backup (_OnlineBackup_)
- TV streaming (_StreamingTV_) and a movie directory (_StreamingMovies_)

The clients can choose either a monthly payment or sign a 1- or 2-year contract. They can use various payment methods and receive an electronic invoice after a transaction.

Interconnect strives to provide seamless connectivity and an array of services to its valued clients. However, the telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and customer churn remains a significant challenge. As clients have more choices than ever before, it is crucial for Interconnect to predict and mitigate customer churn effectively.

To address this concern, we introduce this project, which is a comprehensive initiative designed **to empower Interconnect with the tools and insights needed to identify clients at risk of leaving and, more importantly, to take proactive measures to retain their loyalty**.

By leveraging a wealth of data, including client contracts, personal information, and service usage, this project employs advanced analytics and predictive modeling techniques to forecast customer churn. **When clients exhibit signs of potential churn, they will be offered tailored solutions such as promotional codes and specialized plan options**. This personalized approach aims to enhance client satisfaction and extend their tenure with Interconnect.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is **to reduce client churn and enhance client retention for Interconnect by leveraging data-driven insights**. Specifically, our goal is to:

1. **Minimize Client Churn**: Develop and implement predictive models to identify clients at risk of leaving our services. The aim is to minimize the client churn rate by a significant percentage.

2. **Proactively Retain Clients**: Offer personalized solutions, including promotional codes and customized plan options, to at-risk clients before they decide to leave. We aim to engage with clients in a way that encourages them to stay with Interconnect.

3. **Increase Long-Term Client Loyalty**: Foster long-lasting relationships with clients, extending their tenure with Interconnect.

4. **Achieve Sustainable Growth**: By retaining existing clients and reducing churn, this project aims to contribute to Interconnect's sustainable growth and financial stability in the highly competitive telecommunications industry.
